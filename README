Repositories
------------

The repository tree must have a set of directories, each named after the
package it represents: each of these directories must contain the following
mandatory files:

- build
- outs

Each package directory may also contain the following optional files:

- depends
- sources

The program chroots in a temporary directory before building a package: it is
initialized with a /src directory and a /log file.

- build

This file is an executable which is copied to the /src directory of the
temporary directory and called from it.

Its job is to build the package and install it to the root of the temporary
directory.

- outs

Each line of the outs file must be the absolute path of each file to be
installed to the system.

Empty lines and lines starting with # are ignored.

When uninstalling, all listed files are removed from the system. A package is
considered installed when all listed files exist.

If the first line of the outs file is "#no-chroot", before building this
package, the PREFIX environment variable will be set to the temporary
directory, and the program will not chroot to it. Since this is potentially
unsafe, the user is prompted before installing it.

- depends

Each line of the depends file must be of the following format:

	PACKAGE [runtime]

Empty lines and lines starting with # are ignored.

A valid PACKAGE is the name of a package in the repository.

Each PACKAGE listed here is built prior to the package being built, is
installed to the root of the temporary directory and is ignored when installing
the package.

Additionally, when "runtime" is present after PACKAGE, PACKAGE gets also
installed to the system.

- sources

Each line of the sources file must be of the following format:

	SHA256 URL [RELPATH]

Empty lines and lines starting with # are ignored.

A valid URL is the relative path to a file in the package directory, a
HTTP/HTTPS address or a FTP address.

If URL is a local file, it must not be a directory.

Each source must have a corresponding SHA256 hash.

An optional RELPATH field may be provided: it is the path, relative to /src,
where the fetched source file is moved to after being retrieved and verified.
